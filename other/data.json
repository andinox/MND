Still challenging because of their strong reactivity with SCs, magnetic impurities are usually studied in bulk SCs, thus preventing their manipulation. Here, we show that a single Co adatom can be steadied on the bare Si(100)-2 × 1 surface in a pedestal configuration at low temperature, 9 K, and moved along the reconstructed silicon dimer rows via the use of a scanning tunneling microscope. The electronic characteristics of the Co adatom and its surroundings are investigated via topography and dI/dV measurements. Our findings reveal that the Si–Co bonding involves hybridization between the Si-p and the Co-pxpy orbitals. This configuration indicates that the Co-d orbitals remain weakly hybridized with the silicon atoms. These results are supported by density functional theory calculations where the role of the As dopant is discussed as well as the surface reconstruction. Therefore, we show that the motion direction of the Co adatom can be influenced by the surrounding c(4 × 2) or p(2 × 2) surface reconstruction phases, thus opening future interesting magnetic applications.",

            "desciption": "Acquiring quantitative information on charge transfer (CT) dynamics at the nanoscale remains an important scientific challenge. In particular, CT processes in single molecules at surfaces need to be investigated to be properly controlled in various devices. To address this issue, the dynamics of switching molecules can be exploited. Here, nickel-tetraphenylporphyrin adsorbed on the Si(100) surface is used to study the CT process ruling the reversible activation of two chiral molecular conformations. Via the electrons of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM), a statistical study of molecular switching reveals two specific locations of the molecule for which their efficiency is optimized. The CT mechanism is shown to propagate from two lateral aryl groups towards the porphyrin macrocycle inducing an intramolecular movement of two symmetric pyrroles. The measured switching efficiencies can thus be related to a Markus-Jordner model to estimate relevant parameters that describe the dynamics of the CT process. Numerical simulations provide a precise description of the molecular conformations and unveil the molecular energy levels that are involved in the CT process. This quantitative method opens a completely original approach to study CT at the nanoscale.",

It is important for fundamental studies not only in surface science but also in several applied domains including, for example, miniaturized molecular electronic or for the development of various devices such as nanoscale biosensors or photovoltaic cells. Here, we provide atomic-scale experimental and theoretical investigations of a semi-insulating layer grown on a silicon surface via its epitaxy with CaF2. We show that, following the formation of a wetting layer, the ensuing organized unit cells are coupled to additional physisorbed CaF2 molecules, periodically located in their surroundings. This configuration shapes the formation of ribbons of stripes that functionalize the semiconductor surface. The obtained assembly, having a monolayer thickness, reveals a surface gap energy of ∼3.2 eV. The adsorption of iron tetraphenylporphyrin molecules on the ribbons of stripes is used to estimate the electronic insulating properties of this structure via differential conductance measurements. Density functional theory (DFT) including several levels of complexity (annealing, DFT + U, and nonlocal van der Waals functionals) is employed to reproduce our experimental observations. Our findings offer a unique and robust template that brings an alternative solution to electronic semi-insulating layers on metal surfaces such as NaCl. Hence, CaF2/Si(100) ribbon of stripe structures, whose lengths can reach more than 100 nm, can be used as a versatile surface platform for various atomic-scale studies of molecular devices.",

In this work, we present an investigation of CT dynamics in a single iron tetraphenylporphyrin (Fe-TPP) donor/acceptor dyad adsorbed on a CaF2/Si(100) insulating surface. The tip of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) is used to create local ionic states in one fragment of the dyad. The CT process is monitored by imaging subsequent changes in the neighbor acceptor molecule and its efficiency is mapped revealing the influence of the initial excited state in the donor molecule. In validation of the experiments, simulations based on density functional theory show that holes have a higher donor-acceptor CT rate compared to electrons and highlight a noticeable initial state dependence on the CT process. We leverage the unprecedented spatial resolution achieved in our experiments to show that the CT process in the dyad is governed via molecule-molecule coherent tunneling with negligible surface-mediated character.",

These properties could be exploited in a two-dimensional star-shaped device mixing several crystallographic directions of the surface. By exciting the device electronically, it is possible to switch it from a conducting to a blocked state when a localized band gap is formed in the center of the component.

A statistical study of the I-V and dI/dV signals acquired along the islands show their metallic-like properties and a very small residual conduction band gap of 30 mV. This reveals that the electronic transport through the individual metallic islands at the silicide-silicon interface is mainly ruled by electronic tunnel processes for positive sample biases and driven by the presence of gap states for negative sample voltage. The role of the gap states is demonstrated by performing conductance measurements along the dimer vacancy lines in which interstitial Co atoms are accessible at the silicon surface. Hence, the electronic transport that occurs from the silicide-silicon interface towards the macroscopic contact of the sample can be explained. ",

Our experimental results are correlated with numerical simulations using the density-functional theory with hybrid Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE06) functional to simulate the STM topographies, the projected density of states variations at different depths in the silicon surface as well as the three dimensional partial charge density distributions in real-space. This work reveal that the Si(100) surface exhibit two anticorrugating states at + 0.8 V and + 2.8 V that are associated with a phase shift of the LDOS maximum in the unoccupied states STM topographies. By comparing the calculated data with our experimental results, we have been able to identify the link between the variations of the STM topographies corrugation and the shift of the LDOS maximum observed experimentally. Each surface voltage at which the STM topographies corrugation drops is defined as anticorrugating states. In addition we have evidenced a sharp jump in the tunnel current when the second LDOS maximum shift is probed which origin is discussed and associated with the presence of Van Hove singularities.",

This is achieved by using the tunnel electrons of a low temperature (9 K) scanning tunneling microscope (STM). A statistical analysis of the electronic excitations applied at various positions on the HPB molecule reveal that the hopping process is related to a strong decrease of the tunnel junction conductance. This process is associated to a charge transfer from the silicon surface to the HPB molecule leading to a hopping mechanism that occurs in two sequential steps. The first step of the hopping process involves the formation of an HPB- anion that triggers the molecular motion into a metastable state. The second step is related to the neutralization of the HPB-anion which provokes the manipulation of the molecule to its final steady position. Our experimental data are supported by the calculations of the relaxed molecule using the density functional theory on the Si(100) surface that takes the Van-der-Waals forces interactions into account. Additional calculations of the HPB- anion orbitals depict the spatial localization of the extra charge inside the HPB molecule and the relative energies of the HPB- molecular orbitals.

Following precisely located dI/dV measurements at various specific positions [phenyls, pyrroles, and Er-(acac)], the relative locations of the Er cation and the apical ligand (acac) can be deciphered for each observed conformation. Hence, one of the adsorbate conformations presents the acac ligand parallel to the porphyrin plane with the Er atom outside the macrocycle plane. The second conformation is related to what is known in the gas phase, where the acac ligand is oriented vertically on top of the Er atom. This work is combined with a theoretical investigation that uses density functional theory methods to bring into light details of the two observed conformations. Additional proofs of our discoveries are related to the vibrational excitations of ErTPP-(acac). A comparison with a theoretical estimation of the vibrational modes reveals how the electronic resonance near the valence-band edge of the insulting layer is suitable to distinguish between the two adsorbed conformations.",
