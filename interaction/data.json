The epitaxial growth of these structures is obtained by the evaporation of CaF2 molecules on the silicon surface at the transition between the VW and SK modes.

Still challenging because of their strong reactivity with SCs, magnetic impurities are usually studied in bulk SCs, thus preventing their manipulation. Here, we show that a single Co adatom can be steadied on the bare Si(100)-2 × 1 surface in a pedestal configuration at low temperature, 9 K, and moved along the reconstructed silicon dimer rows via the use of a scanning tunneling microscope. The electronic characteristics of the Co adatom and its surroundings are investigated via topography and dI/dV measurements. Our findings reveal that the Si–Co bonding involves hybridization between the Si-p and the Co-pxpy orbitals. This configuration indicates that the Co-d orbitals remain weakly hybridized with the silicon atoms. These results are supported by density functional theory calculations where the role of the As dopant is discussed as well as the surface reconstruction. Therefore, we show that the motion direction of the Co adatom can be influenced by the surrounding c(4 × 2) or p(2 × 2) surface reconstruction phases, thus opening future interesting magnetic applications.",

In particular, CT processes in single molecules at surfaces need to be investigated to be properly controlled in various devices. To address this issue, the dynamics of switching molecules can be exploited. Here, nickel-tetraphenylporphyrin adsorbed on the Si(100) surface is used to study the CT process ruling the reversible activation of two chiral molecular conformations. Via the electrons of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM), a statistical study of molecular switching reveals two specific locations of the molecule for which their efficiency is optimized. The CT mechanism is shown to propagate from two lateral aryl groups towards the porphyrin macrocycle inducing an intramolecular movement of two symmetric pyrroles. The measured switching efficiencies can thus be related to a Markus-Jordner model to estimate relevant parameters that describe the dynamics of the CT process. Numerical simulations provide a precise description of the molecular conformations and unveil the molecular energy levels that are involved in the CT process. This quantitative method opens a completely original approach to study CT at the nanoscale.",

It is important for fundamental studies not only in surface science but also in several applied domains including, for example, miniaturized molecular electronic or for the development of various devices such as nanoscale biosensors or photovoltaic cells. Here, we provide atomic-scale experimental and theoretical investigations of a semi-insulating layer grown on a silicon surface via its epitaxy with CaF2. We show that, following the formation of a wetting layer, the ensuing organized unit cells are coupled to additional physisorbed CaF2 molecules, periodically located in their surroundings. This configuration shapes the formation of ribbons of stripes that functionalize the semiconductor surface. The obtained assembly, having a monolayer thickness, reveals a surface gap energy of ∼3.2 eV. The adsorption of iron tetraphenylporphyrin molecules on the ribbons of stripes is used to estimate the electronic insulating properties of this structure via differential conductance measurements. Density functional theory (DFT) including several levels of complexity (annealing, DFT + U, and nonlocal van der Waals functionals) is employed to reproduce our experimental observations. Our findings offer a unique and robust template that brings an alternative solution to electronic semi-insulating layers on metal surfaces such as NaCl. Hence, CaF2/Si(100) ribbon of stripe structures, whose lengths can reach more than 100 nm, can be used as a versatile surface platform for various atomic-scale studies of molecular devices.",

The tip of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) is used to create local ionic states in one fragment of the dyad. The CT process is monitored by imaging subsequent changes in the neighbor acceptor molecule and its efficiency is mapped revealing the influence of the initial excited state in the donor molecule. In validation of the experiments, simulations based on density functional theory show that holes have a higher donor-acceptor CT rate compared to electrons and highlight a noticeable initial state dependence on the CT process. We leverage the unprecedented spatial resolution achieved in our experiments to show that the CT process in the dyad is governed via molecule-molecule coherent tunneling with negligible surface-mediated character.",

A statistical study of the I-V and dI/dV signals acquired along the islands show their metallic-like properties and a very small residual conduction band gap of 30 mV. This reveals that the electronic transport through the individual metallic islands at the silicide-silicon interface is mainly ruled by electronic tunnel processes for positive sample biases and driven by the presence of gap states for negative sample voltage. The role of the gap states is demonstrated by performing conductance measurements along the dimer vacancy lines in which interstitial Co atoms are accessible at the silicon surface. Hence, the electronic transport that occurs from the silicide-silicon interface towards the macroscopic contact of the sample can be explained. ",

This work reveal that the Si(100) surface exhibit two anticorrugating states at + 0.8 V and + 2.8 V that are associated with a phase shift of the LDOS maximum in the unoccupied states STM topographies. By comparing the calculated data with our experimental results, we have been able to identify the link between the variations of the STM topographies corrugation and the shift of the LDOS maximum observed experimentally. Each surface voltage at which the STM topographies corrugation drops is defined as anticorrugating states.

This is achieved by using the tunnel electrons of a low temperature (9 K) scanning tunneling microscope (STM). A statistical analysis of the electronic excitations applied at various positions on the HPB molecule reveal that the hopping process is related to a strong decrease of the tunnel junction conductance. This process is associated to a charge transfer from the silicon surface to the HPB molecule leading to a hopping mechanism that occurs in two sequential steps. The first step of the hopping process involves the formation of an HPB- anion that triggers the molecular motion into a metastable state. The second step is related to the neutralization of the HPB-anion which provokes the manipulation of the molecule to its final steady position. Our experimental data are supported by the calculations of the relaxed molecule using the density functional theory on the Si(100) surface that takes the Van-der-Waals forces interactions into account. Additional calculations of the HPB- anion orbitals depict the spatial localization of the extra charge inside the HPB molecule and the relative energies of the HPB- molecular orbitals.

Following precisely located dI/dV measurements at various specific positions [phenyls, pyrroles, and Er-(acac)], the relative locations of the Er cation and the apical ligand (acac) can be deciphered for each observed conformation. Hence, one of the adsorbate conformations presents the acac ligand parallel to the porphyrin plane with the Er atom outside the macrocycle plane. The second conformation is related to what is known in the gas phase, where the acac ligand is oriented vertically on top of the Er atom. This work is combined with a theoretical investigation that uses density functional theory methods to bring into light details of the two observed conformations.

            "desciption": "In this chapter, we give a short review about the methods that are commonly used to passivate the Si(100) surface with hydrogen atoms. The wet technique is discussed in terms of surface pollution and surface roughness. A basic recipe is given. A second part is devoted to the methods commonly used with vacuum techniques. A discussion is done on the hydrogenation parameters to improve the surface quality at the atomic scale in particular the one that concerns the formation of various phases such as the 3x1 and dihydride. A third method is also detailed and enable the surface hydrogenation at the atomic scale. ",

            "desciption": "The present chapter depicts various theoretical methods that have been used in the context of experimental studies at the nanoscale. With the scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), we can investigate the manipulation of individual molecules and their electronic properties through electronically induced excitations. To explore in details the surface dynamics of a molecule in a bistable or quadristable motion, the nudged elastic band method is used to describe the energy barrier of the saddle point located along the molecular reaction pathway. When the physisorbed stilbene molecule is studied on the bare Si(100), the tight binding method is associated to the density functional theory (DFT) to simulate the scanning tunneling topographies. The physisorption of a molecule such as the hexaphenyle-benzene at the step edge of the Si(100) show particular lateral movements which diffusion barrier can be described accurately by the dispersive term added to the DFT to describe van der Waals interactions (DFT-D). In order to identify the nature of bonding of a porphyrin molecule adsorbed on a boron doped silicon surface, we have analyzed the Laplacian of the charge density. Finally, we present a full DFT-D study of a bidimensional nanoporous supramolecular network on a silicon surface. We have evaluated the molecule-molecule and molecule-substrate interactions energies that are key parameters to understand the mechanism of formation of these networks. In this context, the simulations of STM images with multi-diffusion with the presence of a tungsten tip show a better agreement with the experimental observations than the Tersoff-Hamann approach.",

Manipulating individual molecules on surfaces using scanning tunneling microscopy has been the subject of intense research over the last decade. However, controlled and reproducible manipulation has been achieved only recently. Particular emphasis will be placed on the versatility of STM-induced electronic excitation as the principal physical process behind single-molecule manipulation.",

Their properties, specific to their small sizes, have a role similar to that of an isolated atom with discretes energy levels. Thus, the electronic levels of a BQ are discrete and defined at a specific energy, unlike those of a solid that are spread on a band of energy. The advantage of the QD over the individual atom lies in the fact that the BQ is electronically isolated from its environment and therefore offers a confined electronic structure. In this context, coupling QDs in order to exploit them as functional devices is therefore a compromise between controlling their size and confinement and controlling the interactions with their environment.",
